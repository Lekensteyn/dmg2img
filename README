DMG2IMG is a tool which allows converting Apple compressed dmg 
archives to standard (hfsplus) image disk files.

This tool handles zlib and bzip2 compressed dmg images.


USAGE:
    dmg2img [-l] [-p N] [-s] [-v] [-V] [-d] <input.dmg> [<output.img>]
or
    dmg2img -i <input.dmg> -o <output.img>
    
It is derived from dmg2iso v0.2c by vu1tur <to@vu1tur.eu.org>


NOTES: 

1. An equivalent command under Mac OS X would be:
hdiutil convert <input.dmg> -format UDTO -o <output.img>

2. Under linux, the image disk file can be mounted with the commands

modprobe hfsplus
mount -t hfsplus -o loop <output.img> /mnt

[normally, only 'root' might be able to do this]

3. Windows users should be able to open the image disk file with UltraISO.

COMPILATION:

The default included Makefile is for Linux/gcc. The development files 
in zlib-dev and libbz2-dev are needed to compile dmg2img, and those
in openssl-dev are needed to compile vfdecrypt.


CHANGELOG:

1.0     3 August 2007
        * Initial version 

1.1     4 August 2008
        * Fixed segfault bug occurring when decompressing certain dmg files
          beyond the actual end of the file (due to not correctly setting
          the size of the compressed parts ...)
        * Added slightly modified vfdecrypt utility from 
          Weinmann-Appelbaum-Fromme in order to decrypt encrypted dmg files.

1.2    17 September 2008
        * Fixed segfault bug due to buffer overflow (buffer sizes
          incorrectly set, resulting in insufficient memory allocation).
        * Fixed most compilation warnings - remaining ones are
          irrelevant with standard compilers.
	
1.3    19 September 2008
        * Further fixes which (hopefully) enable dmg2img to work on
          dmg archives of arbitrary size, while reducing RAM usage a lot.
        * A lot of thanks to Alfred E. Hegge and Randy Broman for testing
          and reporting bugs.

1.4     5 April 2009
        * Applied patch from Vladimir 'phcoder' Serbinenko which brings
          correct handling of 64bit integers in koly signature and
          plist data, and should enable dmg2img to work on huge 
          archives > 4GBytes (tested by 'phcoder').
        * Added support for dmg archives involving bzip2 instead of zlib
          compression (this has not received much testing yet, as those
          archives are still unfrequent).
        * Many thanks to Pierre Duhem for useful hints.

1.4.1   6 April 2009
        * Fixed a bug in writing the output file that caused some DMG images
          to convert to a broken unmountable IMG image.

1.5     8 April 2009
        * Fixed a bug in parsing plist for image partitions.
        * Added support for ADC-compressed dmg images.

1.5.1  11 April 2009
        * Added missing zero block type.
        * Small fixes and clean up.

1.6    15 April 2009
        * Added support for dmg images that only have binary resource fork
          but no XML plist. 
        * Refined koly block processing.
        * Fixed a bug in finding the offset for the next compressed block
          when offsets are defined relative to the current partition.
        * Fixed broken progress indicator.
        * Added detection of images with GUID Partition Table and respective 
          mount commands in linux.

1.6.1  12 August 2009
        * Fixed a bug in handling large files on win32 systems.

1.6.2  24 March 2010
        * Fixed a bug in processing a terminal block type.
        * Added periodic flushing of debug log file.

1.6.3  07 April 2012
        * Added option -l to list partitions
        * Added option -p to extract only specific partition
        * Added support for a rare case scenario of koly block being at the
          the beginning of the image (thanks to Friik)

1.6.4  25 April 2012
        * Compilation bugfix (Linux)

1.6.5  23 July 2013
        * Fixed a bug in handling some types of dmg files
